 How did you manage fund/scholarship: ISU is the no 1 ranked university in the field of Agricultural Engineering and while I was applying, I never imagined that I will go to this uni. Later, I got admission in U of Arizona and ISU. There were 8 professors in the land and water management research group and I mailed 7 of them before mid-February and none of them has opening in their group. In April, I mailed the last professor and it was a copy paste email as I was expected nothing from this Uni.

 List of Uni you got admission(optional): Uni of Arizona and ISU
 Any advice for aspirants: The journey is long and requires patience. I was unlucky in many ways and lucky in the best possible way. A professor from Texas Tech Uni was positive to take me in his group and offered me funding. Just 3 days before his final decision, Trump administration banned all hiring in state funded research. A female professor from Uni of Nebraska- Lincoln told me to join her research group and she also told me to come as earlier as possible. However, the admission committee rejected my application due to low score in verbal. So, don’t lose hope if you are being rejected. Try hard.

Any advice for aspirants: It is very hard to get into Pharmacy schools with medium profile. It is very easy to get into chemistry and biochemistry programs. Applying to both biochemistry/chemistry and pharmacy schools (by matching the profile and the schools) are recommended. I regret not applying to some biochemistry programs which are pretty good. It doesn’t matter whether you get into Pharmacy schools or not, it is the research that matters. A lot of biochemistry professors work with  diseases and you can easily get into that. Applying to biochemistry/chemistry will give you options (While making final decisions) that you wish- you had.

 Any advice for aspirants: আমি আমার নিজের অভিজ্ঞতা থেকে বলছি। উচ্চশিক্ষার ৩ তি ফান্ডা আসে।
 ১) যত পারেন ইমেইল করেন।
 ২) যত পারেন অ্যাপ্লাই করেন।
 ৩) যত আগে পারেন অ্যাপ্লাই করেন।
 আমি গ্যারান্টি দিয়ে বলতে পারি যদি আপনার আশেপাশে কেউ ফান্ড পাচ্ছে না, ৯০% ক্ষেত্রে তার কোন একটাতে কমতি আছে। আমি কিন্তু এখানে GRE, TOEFL নিয়ে কিছু বলি নাই। আপনার প্রোফাইল যাই হোক না কেন আপনি যদি এই ৩ তা ফান্ডা সুন্দর ভাবে সম্পন্ন করেন আপনার ফান্ড হবেই ( obviously with the clemency of GOD)।

How did you apply: Contacted Professor, he encouraged to apply. I applied in time.
How did you manage fund/scholarship: Google sites -এ নিজের একটা Portfolio সাইট -তৈরি করেছিলাম + সেটার লিঙ্ক-সহ নিজের গুণগান গেয়ে একটা 'ইমেইল' ফরম্যাট তৈরি করেছি। তারপর অর্ধসহস্রাধিক প্রফেসরের প্রোফাইল ঘেটে তাঁদের মধ্য থেকে ৯৫ জনকে নক করেছি। ২০ জনের কাছ থেকে রিপ্লাই পেয়েছি - ১ জন পুরাই নেগেটিভ, একজন রিসার্চ প্রপোজাল দিতে বলেছিলেন (পাত্তা দিই নাই - সময় ছিলোনা রিসার্চ প্রপোজাল লিখার ...।), আর বাকি-রা মোটামুটি নন-নেগেটিভ রিপ্লাই দিয়েছেন (বেশিরভাগই, "এপ্লাই করো/ভর্তি হও তারপর দেখা যাবে" টাইপের - এক দুইজন কিছুটা বেশি আগ্রহ দেখিয়েছেন) । এঁদের ভিতর যার রিপ্লাই বেশি শক্তিশালী মনে হয়েছে এরকম ১০-১২-টা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় বাছাই করে এপ্লাই করেছিলাম। ফেব্রুয়ারি-তে ASU-তে এডমিশন এর সিদ্ধান্ত জানানোর পর যেই প্রফেসরের সাথে যোগাযোগ করেছিলাম, তাঁকে নক করে বললাম যে ভর্তি তো হইছি, এখন আপনার ল্যাবে RA দিবেন কি-না দেখেন ...। (এর মধ্যে হঠাৎ একদিন খেয়াল করলাম ডিপার্টমেন্টে -TA-এর জন্য আলাদাভাবে এপ্লাই করা লাগে - সেটা এক ফাঁকে করে রাখলাম।) তারপর কিছুদিন অপেক্ষা করলাম; ওই প্রফেসর নিজে কিছু বললেন না। তাঁর ল্যাবের পোলাপান দিয়ে ইন্টারভিউ নেয়ালেন। ইন্টারভিউ তেমন ভাল হয় নাই। এইজন্য মনে হয় RA offer -করে নাই। এর কিছুদিন পর Department থেকে TA'র অফার দিলো + Doctoral Fellowship -এর অফার দিলো।

Special note about application to this uni: ASU পাবলিক বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়। এদের মনে হয় কিছু কিছু খারাপ ছাত্র নেয়ার আলাদা কোটা আছে, এইজন্য আমাকে ফান্ড দিয়ে ভর্তি করেছে (joking)। সিরিয়াসলি বলতেছি- যতদূর বুঝলাম, কতোজনকে ভর্তি করাবে এইরকম কোন লিমিট সম্ভবত এঁদের নাই। যাদের যোগ্যতা আছে সবাইকে এরা ভর্তি অফার করবে - এইরকম কোন নিয়ম আছে মনে হয়। (আমার ক্ষেত্রে আসলে আমার কর্মক্ষেত্রে অভিজ্ঞতা এবং টোফেলের স্কোর-টা TA -পাওয়ার ক্ষেত্রে বেশি কাজে দিয়েছে, ডক্টরাল ফেলোশিপ-টা কী বুঝে আমাকে দিলো সেটা অবশ্য বুঝতে পারতেছিনা...।)

Any advice for aspirants: যথেষ্ঠ সময় হাতে রেখে মাঠে নামা উচিৎ (প্রথম ধাপ, জুলাই-আগস্টের মধ্যে GRE+TOEFL দিয়ে দেয়া - Fall session -ধরার জন্য)। নিজের ঢোল নিজে পিটাতে হবে (তবে বেশি পিটাতে গিয়ে যেন ফেঁটে না যায় সেদিকে লক্ষ্য রাখা উচিত)। "CGPA কম", "Publication না থাকা" - এই সব গুনে যদি গুণান্বিত হয়ে থাকেন, তাহলে GRE/GMAT/TOEFL/IELTS -এইসবে যতদূর সম্ভব ভাল স্কোর তোলা দরকার। আমি প্রথমবার GRE -দিয়ে আশানুরূপ ফল না পেয়ে এক মাস পর আবার দিয়েছিলাম। আর নিজের গবেষনার আগ্রহের দিকে খেয়াল রেখে যতো বেশি প্রফেসরকে সম্ভব নক করা উচিত।

How did you apply: I was not sure whether I would apply for fall,17 or wait for next year, emailed around 30 - 40 professors from different universities (after that I quit emailing), got one very positive reply though I didn’t apply there later, others didn’t show any interests. Finally, I applied directly to 6 Universities according to my research interests and higher acceptance rate in mechanical engineering from Bangladesh. OSU is one of them.
How did you manage fund/scholarship: After reviewing my application centrally, three professors from OSU emailed me for skype interview (Two of them are mentioned in my SOP, one from the field I’m interested in working on). After the individual interview sessions, two of them showed interest, I expressed my preference, and my preferred professor sent me an offer letter a few days later. 
Special note about application to this uni: They provide good funds for master’s degree. I think OSU ME dept. puts similar emphasis to every application. So, if you can’t convince any professors through email, apply directly with a strong SOP.
 List of Uni you got admission(optional): North Dakota State University, OSU, Boise State University, Wright State University, University of Toledo, Miami University (all for M.Sc. degree).
 Email/Fb id link(Optional): 
Any advice for aspirants: It’s not impossible to get fully funded masters admission if you knock the right doors. Emailing professors is must, try to get as many positive responses as you can (Even though I couldn’t manage to do that properly). If you fail to do so, don’t lose hope and apply directly. Target those universities which have a number of professors and research labs working on the topics you’re interested in working on. If you don’t have much research experience, select your research interest wisely and express it in your SOP precisely, then perhaps your application will do most of the tricks.

How did you apply: Contacted Professor at mid October for Fall 2017 session but he encouraged me to apply Spring instead. In fact, it was my first email. Got super lucky I guess.
How did you manage fund/scholarship: As soon as I got the admission, professor offered me RA+TA.
Special note about application to this uni: I hardly found anyone in Bangladesh who hasn't thought that this university is in Florida. Very few people in our country know about this university as this university is mainly focused on undergrad (actually it's really really a very good one in undergrad, but not that good in grad obviously). As so far in engineering, it has only MS program, there's a chance of getting fund in MS here and the fund amount is really good. It's quite a good university in Chemistry, Biology, Psychology (and Business, but funding chance is very low there) etc as they have PhD program and fund is really really high. Last of all, though it's not a great university for grad people in engineering, it's one of the nicest college towns, was ranked 1st by Forbes in 2016 I guess. And I really like the small BD community here.

Missed all deadlines.... Applied for PhD at Mercer anyway (Because one of the professors working at Mercer was the best possible match for me)....

How did you manage fund/scholarship: The professor and his team liked me in the interview .
Special note about application to this uni: Good GRE score.... Minimum TOEFL requirement is 100, (they don't accept IELTS scores).. They require degree evaluation from a third party like WES.

How did you apply: A senior from my undergrad university is a current PhD student of University of Florida. He posted on a facebook group that his supervisor was looking for students. I contacted with the professor taking the guidance from my senior. The professor told me to apply and I applied. 
How did you manage fund/scholarship: The professor offered me RA position and the department waived my tuition fees and provided health insurance also. 
Special note about application to this uni: Competition is too tough. But if you can manage a professor, the rest is all set. The graduate programmes have some fixed requirements e.g.for PhD admission GRE 315+, but if your other credentials are well enough to convince the professor, you may have the chance. So focus on each and every details of your profile (CGPA, GRE, IELTS/TOEFL, SOP, LOR etc.).
Any advice for aspirants: If you are really interested in higher study, make plans for starting your preparation just after you are done with your graduation (or in the last semester). Create an active network with your seniors who are studying or studied in different institutions around the world, believe me it helps! Don't be freaked out about the application deadlines. Though it's best to apply way before the application deadline, but at the end of the day, professor him/herself is the one who can pass you through the admission committee even if you want to apply later than the deadline(Application deadline to my intended university was December 5, 2016 but I applied on May 2017. Could manage because the professor was interested in hiring a student.). But again, this may not be the case in general. So apply as fast as you can. Work with your SOP that truly reflects your intentions and interests of research in specific field.
