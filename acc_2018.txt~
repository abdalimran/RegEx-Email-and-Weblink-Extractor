List of Uni you got admission(optional): Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), USA. Others are still pending.
Any advice for aspirants: Make a list of uni that matches with your profile. See their minimum requirements. Contact potential professors beforehand, like at least from August. Mail at least 150 professors within August-September-October, read their background, be very specific and go for the hit. I started mailing from November which was definitely a terrible action to take. Having publications will be a very good plus point. Don’t mail more than 1 prof. from same lab at a time. Consult with your friends and brothers/sisters who are already abroad. Don’t aim too high or too low. And most importantly, don’t lose hope. I got two supervisors (1 Bangladeshi, 1 Canadian) I could only dream of. The Canadian one is a celebrity professor who didn’t even see my mails. But I got chance to be under him. All praises go to Almighty Allah. Never lose hope. That’s it.

How did you apply: Contacted a professor, he told me to apply.
How did you manage fund/scholarship: The fund came with the admission package.
Special note about the application to this uni: Individual faculties have no power over admission. If a professor tells you to apply, he probably thinks you have a chance of getting admitted.
List of Uni you got admission(optional): Iowa State University (MS, Civil Engineering (Transportation), Full-fund).
Any advice for aspirants: Professor response doesn't matter for top schools because they simply don't compete by grabbing students before one another (because its beneath them). So apply whether you get replies or not. As for other universities, if you are trying to contact professors, don't send them a generic email asking for a position as a research assistant. Read their papers, ask them questions. They like that. After 3 emails, ask them if they have a position open or not. This is way more effective. If you want to go to a good school, invest the time. Other components of your application (other that GRE, TOEFL, CGPA) such as SoP, LoR matter a lot. Work on them. Review the SoP so many times (as many as 20 times), that it is squeaky clean, and the language is clear as diamond. You can always find fund, no need to wait for fall.

Undergrad and Graduate Department: Pharmacy
IELTS/TOEFL Score (W,R,S,L): 7 
GRE/GMAT Score (Verbal and Quantitative): 313 (V-150, Q-163, AWA-3.5)
Publications: 15+ original research and review articles, Citation: 203, h-index: 9, i-10 index: 9 according to Google Scholar. Conference proceedings at the international conferences in Austria and Switzerland.
Job Experience: 3+ years at the University of Turku, Finland funded by EU and PCS.
Research Experience: 5 years in different research projects in Bangladesh and Finland.
How did you apply: Direct application to the department. I had a recommendation letter from Professor Emeritus of the University of Illinois at Chicago, USA.
How did you manage fund/scholarship: I applied directly to the department without contacting any professor. Admission committee took the video interview. Director, Dean, coordinator, and other two professors were present in the interview. They only asked HR related and behavioral questions to test my thinking and psychology as a graduate student. There was no question related to any academic subject. I had many research experience that’s why they asked some questions related to my international collaborations and so on. They asked what I will do in the department and my future planning, etc. The interview was only 17 minutes. After 3 weeks, the department awarded the funding with some appreciations of my interview performance and qualifications.
Special note about the application to this uni: The University of Iowa is ranked 17 in Pharmaceutical Sciences Ph.D. program. Getting admission is very competitive. Acceptance rate is less than 1% and much harder for international students. Emailing professors doesn’t help here. Besides that there are few Pharmaceutics Ph.D. program in the USA, that’s why application volume is very very high.
List of Uni you got admission(optional): I applied for only Pharmaceutical Sciences Ph.D. program in other universities. I was interviewed by 7 other graduate schools, but their decision is still pending.
Any advice for aspirants: Direct application is preferred for Pharmaceutical Sciences Ph.D. program in most of the high ranked schools. Individual professors can’t help here. That’s why better to apply as many as universities you can afford. But there are some schools where you should send email to professors, for instance, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Texas Tech Health Science Center, University of Connecticut, Oregon State University, Auburn University, etc. These universities admit students directly to the lab of specific advisor. But if you apply to the top 20 schools then emailing is not helpful because admission committee doses everything there and they have on campus requirement events. I emailed to only few professors and got reply in more than 95% cases. Try to write email very specifically and customize it for the professor so that they will get a good impression on you. I wouldn’t recommend writing generic email to many professors. Do your homework before emailing. I had to spend more than 30 minutes to write an email.

Research Experience: 3 years and 1.5 years from USA, medical School research lab in Neuropharmacology/Neuroscience . 
How did you apply: Direct application to the department and also professor contact. All recommenders from USA. 
How did you manage fund/scholarship: I tried to contact with professors, few professors like my profile from different universities but if university ranking is high professor can play little role! 
Here, ( I got fund ) I gave 10 slots interviews with Admission committee and professors individually from morning 8am to evening 5 pm . Then after 1.5 months they confirmed me. 
Special note about the application to this University: This university is not high ranked with this program but this is affiliated with Rowan School of Osteopathic Medical School which high ranked. This location+ Scholarship made it super attractive. You must fight with American students, As I know I am the only international student. They take 4-5 students each year, admission will accompany with all benefits. I asked one of applicant about her GRE score, she told me 80 percentile in math , 88/89 percentile in English and 92 percentile in AWA. 
So, how did I fight with them with my low GRE? My SOP was good, Recommenders are better than them, I guess my last degree GPA also higher than them , most importantly : I have more research experience than anyone of them! My interview was good too. 
List of Uni you got admission(optional): Northeastern University ( MS in Pharmacology ). Two other kept me in waiting ( University of Tennessee Health and University of Texas Health San Antonio Neuroscience)

How did you apply: Both direct application, and emailed professors with similar research interests. 
How did you manage fund/scholarship: Centrally distributed 
Special note about the application to this uni: First, one needs to be shortlisted for the interview. Based on the interview, final decisions are made. Strong SOP, and strong LOR backed up to get into one of the top three WGS PhD programs

Any advice for aspirants: Applying with such terrible GRE score is like gambling. Since there are a handful number of US WGS PhDs. You won't find any formal subject ranking because WGS is not a disciplinary subject. Targeting traditional/rigorous Social Science disciplines did not help much coming from/having an interdisciplinary background/critical thinking training.

Any advice for aspirants: Last year I applied 8 Universities in their Public Health programs. Got 7 admission and partial funding from only 2 universities. So, I decided that I will switch my career track to basic medical science research. This time I started emailing from September, 2017 and wrote email to almost 200 Professors. I have attented 7 skype interviews. Almost everyone (Mainly Doctors) told me that it is almost impossible to get admission in PhD program at USA for medical students without any Masters (As MBBS curriculum in BD is not research oriented and usually we do not conduct any research throughout the MBBS course). But here I am. Have gotten admission with full fund in Biological Science PhD program. :) 
So, just believe in yourself and try your best.

How did you apply: Contacted my future adviser and he told me at the very beginning that he is willing to take me as his RA. Then I applied.
How did you manage fund/scholarship: I talked with the Professor via Skype 8 months ago and intended to apply for Fall'18. He encouraged me to apply for Summer'18 and told me that he will ensure that my program would be fully funded. I kept in touch with him last few months.

Any advice for aspirants: 
১) এক কৌশলে কাজ না হলে আরেক কৌশল বের করতে হবে। শুধু লেগে থাকলেই চলবে না, স্মার্টলি + স্ট্র্যাটেজিকেলি লেগে থাকতে হবে, যেটা বুঝতে আমার চার বছর লেগেছে। হাহাহা! I'm not that smart. এক বছর না হলে সে বছরের প্রসেসিংয়ে কোথায় ভুল হয়েছে, সেটা বের করে পরবর্তীতে চেষ্টা করতে হবে। 
STEM রিলেটেড সাবজেক্টগুলোতে কোন ভার্সিটির কোন প্রফেসর কেমন ফান্ড পেয়েছে, সেটা জানার জন্য https://report.nih.gov/award/ ভালো একটা ওয়েবসাইট। এছাড়াও সময় সময় আমি গুগলে সার্চ দিতাম "Assistantship opportunity for nutrition in US" লিখে। এভাবেই SLU-এর অ্যাসিস্টেন্টশিপের সার্কুলার চোখে পড়েছিলো। আপনাকেও বিভিন্ন উপায়ে চিরুনি তল্লাশি চালাতে হবে। 

২) প্রফেসরদের সাথে যোগাযোগ করা অবশ্য কর্তব্য। তবে প্রফেসর রিপ্লাই না দিলে যে ঐ ভার্সিটিতে এপ্লাই করার দরকার নেই, এমনটা নয়। নিজের প্রোফাইলের সাথে মিলে গেলে আপনার পছন্দের ভার্সিটিতে সরাসরি এপ্লাই করতে পারেন। GRA পাওয়ার সম্ভাবনা না থাকতে পারে, GTA কম কীসে?

৩) কোনো ভার্সিটি থেকে যদি প্রফেসর পজিটিভ রিপ্লাইও দেন, তাও অন্তত ৩টা ভার্সিটিতে এপ্লাই করা উচিৎ। পরপর দুই বছর আমি এই ভুল করেছিলাম। দুটো ভার্সিটি থেকেই প্রফেসররা আমাকে নেবেন বলেছিলেন। বিশটারও বেশি মেইল চালাচালি হয়েছিলো উনাদের সাথে। অথচ দিনশেষে পেয়েছি রিজেকশন লেটার। আসলে এডমিশন ডিসিশন উইথ ফান্ড না আসা পর্যন্ত কোনোকিছুই ফাইনাল নয়। তাই প্রফেসরের কথার উপর ভিত্তি করে শুধু একটা ভার্সিটিতেই এপ্লাই করে নিশ্চিন্ত থাকা উচিৎ হবে না। 

৪) পড়াশোনা সম্পর্কিত চাকরির অভিজ্ঞতা না থাকলেও, কিংবা মেজর সাবজেক্টের বাইরে গিয়ে সম্পূর্ণ অন্য ফিল্ডে চাকরি করলেও ফান্ড সহকারে এডমিশন পাওয়া যায়। আমি তার জ্বলন্ত প্রমাণ। কিন্তু আপনাকে SOP-তে খুব সুন্দর করে যুক্তি দিয়ে বুঝাতে হবে যে, কেন আপনি মেজর সম্পর্কিত চাকরি না করে অন্য ফিল্ডের চাকরি করছেন। এডমিশন কমিটিকে কনভিন্স করতে পারলে ফান্ড সহকারে এডমিশন পাওয়া সম্ভব।

Before applying, email the Grad coordinators about your eligibility and maximum fund provided by the University. Passion and Patience are the keys.

Completing the two courses from elsewhere can be helpful. On an average, GRE gets preference for Economics programs and GMAT gets preference for Finance programs.

US university application process is very complex and lengthy. Persistence and patience are key here. One should be smart in planning and organizing all the necessary data such as organizing the list of the universities already applied and yet to be applied, program requirement, deadline, funding opportunity, etc. 
Program selection should be done carefully. For example, if you are looking for funding, you shouldn't apply to those programmes that don't have an assistantship.

Any advice for aspirants: If you want to apply for fall semester, try to be done with TOEFL/IELTS and GRE by August. That way you will have a good amount of time to write SOPs, LORs and selecting universities. Many universities start their application process in October. Therefore, make sure you have your required scores and materials before then. The earlier your apply, the more chance you have in getting into a particular school. As someone who sat for IELTS, I recommend you to go for TOEFL if you want to apply for schools in US/Canada. Sending IELTS scores is more complicated and time consuming. Good luck!

GRE Score (Verbal and Quantitative): 317 ( 149, 168) 
Publications: 1 in Scientific Reports
Job Experience: 8 months in University of Asia pacific (UAP)
Research Experience: Nothing beyond undergrad
How did you apply: Mailed a few professors, but did not get any positive reply. Just applied to some selected universities without any surety (kind of gambling)
How did you manage fund/scholarship: Got admission through central decision as I could not manage any profs ( actually didn't try). Firstly they offered TAship, then a professor contacted me and offered me RAship.
List of Uni you got admission(optional): University of Michigan - Ann Arbor (MSc, No Fund)
Any advice for aspirants: I mailed only a few profs and when I did not get any reply, I stopped mailing. That was a very bad decision I think. It's good if your GRE score is good, but it's also okay if your score is less than 320.

How did I apply : Sent mails to about 60/70 professors from 17/18 different universities. Got few generic replies. All of them indicated professors won't be able to help with the admission process. Got fraustrated because I was always advised by the seniors to apply to the universities after getting positive replies. Applied to five universities, 1 with slightly poisitve reply, 2 with generic reply, 2 with no reply at all. 
How did you manage fund/scholarship: Central decision. 
Special note about the application to this uni: Admission decisions and funding decisions are mostly central.

Any advice for aspirants: What I felt during my whole admission process is the system has changed a bit. Now-a-days, many universities are taking admission decision centrally. It doesn't mean you don't have to mail the professors you like; just don't give up if you don't get any reply. Apply anyway. Mailing won't confirm your admission but it will help you managing TA/RA.

Research Experience: Undergrad thesis in HCI
How did I apply : Sent email to several professors in related field. Got some generic and one very positive reply. Eventually applied to 3 universities..
How did you manage fund/scholarship: A professor from UNR showed great interest in me after evaluating my profile (CV and Portfolio) and offered me funds.
Special note about applying to this university : Many Bangladeshi students are coming to this university lately. There is a good chance of getting funds if you get in touch with a professor early with a decent profile. At least that seem to be the case for CSE. Admission is given centrally, funds by individual departments. 
List of universities I applied to:
1. University of Nevada, Reno (Fully funded)
2. Rochester Institute of Technology, NY (MS, partial funding)
3. NCSU (rejected)
Advice for aspirants: Plan ahead and apply early. I made a mess of managing my time due to holding a job while applying to universities. This is more of a problem if your undergraduate university is in a different city (like my was in khulna). I had to run to khulna several times to issue different documents and ask professors for LoRs. Couldn't apply to almost any of my dream schools eventually. Don't make that mistake.
